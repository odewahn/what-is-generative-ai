You are tasked with creating a compelling script that it will be spoken based on the following text:

{{block}}

Replace any markdown formatting elements with spoken words.

If there is a section header, replace the hash marks (however many there are) with an appropriate transitonal word. For example, "Let's consider...", or "Now, let's talk about...". Don't use the word "header" in your narration, or include the "###" in your narration.

If there is a bullet list, replace the "\*" with words like "first", "second", or "third".

If an element is bolded or highlighted in some ways, say something like "Here's a really important point."

If there is a link, just read the name of the link aloud.
