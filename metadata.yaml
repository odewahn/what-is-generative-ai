description: 'ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and LLaMA are quickly becoming
  household names. These tools and many more are categorized as generative AI, a distinct
  set of techniques within the larger AI field that generate something new: images,
  text, and even video. In this report, Kyle Stratis, lead machine learning engineer
  at Vizit Labs, provides the knowledge and insights you need to navigate generative
  AI.


  Whether you''re a business leader looking to harness generative AI, a developer
  who wants to know how it could impact your craft, or a hobbyist eager to tinker
  with it, you''ll understand the history, applications, benefits, and potential pitfalls
  of this cutting-edge technology.


  You''ll discover how to incorporate generative AI in your daily life, business,
  or creative endeavors to evaluate its return on investment and learn how to implement
  and manage generative AI initiatives.


  With this report, you will:


  * Explore a brief history of generative AI, including modern GenAI architectures,
  and GenAI''s two types

  * Get an introduction to image generators including image GenAI tools, and understand
  the problems facing image GenAI

  * Learn tools that allow you to interact with text-generating large language models,
  including ChatGPT, Google Bard, Anthropic Claude, GitHub Copilot, and more

  * Examine the problems with text generation AI, such as hallucinations, data safety,
  ethics and copyright, and prompt injection


  This report gives you a solid foundation in the current state of generative AI,
  allowing you to evaluate available tools, see if they match your use cases, and
  dive deeper if you choose to.


  *Kyle Stratis has nearly a decade of experience across the AI development lifecycle
  in a variety of domains including computer vision, health technology, and social
